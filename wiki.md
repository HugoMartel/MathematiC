## I. Structures
Our language follows three step to work efficiently :
1. First you need to declare your variables
```
// Declarations
var a = 1;
```
2. Second you need to write your functions and your main code
```
// Functions
def fonction1: (x) => {
    // Function Instructions
    if z<y {
        if y > 0 {
            y = sin(2);
            z = x + y + pi;
        } else {
            z = cos(3);
        }
    } else {
        z =  6*7;
    }
    return a*x^2 + b*x + c;/* simple polynomial */
}

def g: (x) => {
    x += 2;
    return 2*sin(x);
}
```
3. Third you declare the style and intervalle for the curve
```
// Draw Functions
draw fonction1 in [-8,8], g {
    color: ["red", "#00FF00"],
    style: ["dashed", "solid"],
    label: "Fonction 1"
}
```
---
## II. Variables
To declare a variable in our language you need to use
```var =```
You can then name your variable and give it the value you want
```
var variable1 = 1;
```
You can only use alphanumerical character and you end the line with `;`

## III. Functions
---
## IV. Display
---
## V. Index
---
## VI. Keyboard Shortcuts  
You can of course use keyboard shortcuts in the program, some of them can be used everywhere, some other only work when you're typing code,  


| keyboard input |   output    |
|----------------|-------------|
| CTRL + O       | open  file |
| CTRL + S       | save file   |
| CTRL + C       | copy        |
| CTRL + V       | paste       |
| CTRL + X       | cut         |
| CTRL + Q       | select all  |
| CTRL + W       | undo        |
| CTRL + Y       | redo        |
